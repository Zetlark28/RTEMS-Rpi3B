 Task priority:
 A task’s priority determines its importance in relation to the other tasks executing on the same processor. RTEMS supports 255 levels of priority ranging from 1 to 255. The data type rtems_task_priority is used to store task priorities.
 Tasks of numerically smaller priority values are more important tasks than tasks of numerically larger priority values.
